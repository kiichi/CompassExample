# CompassExample

This is an example to rotate a compass image based on the magnetrometer in iPhone. It's objective-c, and iOS version was about 5.x or so. Take it as code snippet and convert it to swift. If you compiling in the latest XCode, just target it to iOS 9 or above so that you can avoid some errors.
